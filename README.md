# ACME's REST interface with docker
- This repository is not complete yet.
- I am still working on dockerize this ACME MERN full-stack web-app.

## About the app
- It is an implementation of an ACME's REST interface that allows a device to store its state in the cloud. This application CRUD service will update the state of a given device when changes.
- I chose to use a React editable table for the UI section. You can find the library at: [DevExtreme React Grid](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/docs/guides/getting-started/)
